# Steps Involved

Drive the TA's Home is an NP-Hard graph problem that can be solved by using the following approximations in polynomial time:

Minimum Spanning Tree, Euler Tour Technique, Dijkstra's Algorithm

Developed using Python3 and Networkx
I converted the graph into a minimum spanning tree and used the Euler Tour Technique to find the optimal tour.
Another technique used was Dijkstra's algorithm when determining the shortest paths home from the nodes in the path.
